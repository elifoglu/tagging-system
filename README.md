# tagging-system

This repo contains both the front-end side and the back-end API of my custom tagging system, which I plan to use for everything.

This repo -and some other repos- is like a playground for me where I make very quick changes when I need to. And that's why there are no tests and that's why I don't follow coding conventions sometimes.
